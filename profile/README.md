# Hi there, Welcome üëã
> Please take some time off to look at my works

üöÄ As a recent Computer Science graduate from the University of British Columbia, I bring a blend of diligence, commitment, and integrity to the tech world. My passion lies in harnessing the power of software to empower individuals and teams to achieve their goals efficiently.

With four years of hands-on experience in Java, coupled with a robust skill set that includes Spring, React.js, MySQL, HTML, CSS, and many others, I have developed a diverse portfolio of projects that showcase my ability to tackle complex challenges and deliver practical solutions.

I'm a firm believer in the power of continuous learning and personal growth. Every day presents a new opportunity to expand my knowledge and refine my skills, ensuring that I am not just a contributor, but a constant innovator in the ever-evolving world of technology.

I'm eager to bring my technical expertise and collaborative spirit to a dynamic team, with which I can contribute to meaningful projects and drive impactful change.
